### Student Mental Health

I am currently involved in a project evaluating the Peer Support service ran within the University of Glasgow's Counselling and Psychological services. The student-led service aims to provide support for peers with mild mental health issues. I will be involved in the initial stages of a mixed-method investigation to collect the experiences of those involved with the service, and use this to facilitate and inform the upcoming expansion of the program.
