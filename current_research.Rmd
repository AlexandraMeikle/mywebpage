### Student Mental Health


**Research Project** <br>

I am currently involved in a project evaluating the University of Glasgow's [CaPS Peer Support service] (https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/counselling/peersupport/). The student-led service aims to provide information and support for students with mild mental health issues. I will be involved in the initial stages of a mixed-method investigation to collect the experiences of those involved with the service, and use this to facilitate and inform the upcoming expansion of the program.


**Systematic Review** <br>

I will also be assisting [Jelena Milicev](http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/?id=JM010) in writing a systematic review on the prevalence of mental health issues in postrgraduate students.
